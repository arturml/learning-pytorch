I'm a TensorFlow/Keras user and I finally decided to give PyTorch a try! I will make an effort to document and share my learning steps in this repository. There are some tutorials at github, such as [this one](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial), but my focus here is learning it myself. You should probably read the [offcial tutorial](http://pytorch.org/tutorials) as a starting point.
